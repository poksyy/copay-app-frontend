# CoPay Frontend

CoPay is a collaborative expense management application designed to simplify the division of costs within groups, such as dinners, trips, or gifts. It allows users to manage shared payments, create collaborative wish lists, and compare prices to find the best deals on products. The backend repository handles all server-side logic, user management, and data processing for these features.

The project is carried out by three team members: **Pau Carrera Nonales**, **Dylan Navarro Vinyarta**, and **Cristian Ora√±a Gamo**. Over the past two years, we have acquired significant knowledge through our vocational studies, complemented by personal projects that have enhanced our technical and collaborative skills.
